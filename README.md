Vidya Mitra: A localized Generative AI educational assistant for rural Gujarat, supporting the GSEB curriculum and 'Gujlish' voice interaction. Developed for the Atmiya AI Hackathon 2026.
Vidya Mitra (વિદ્યા મિત્ર) - AI Tutor for Rural Gujarat

Project for Atmiya AI Hackathon 2026 

Theme: Empowering Social & Rural Future through AI.

🚀 Overview
Vidya Mitra is a localized Generative AI educational assistant designed specifically for students in rural Gujarat. It bridges the gap between complex curriculum and local language by understanding "Gujlish" and providing responses grounded in the GSEB (Gujarat State Education Board) syllabus.

💡 Problem Statement

Students in rural areas often struggle with:

Language Barrier: General AI tools provide "robotic" translations that don't match local dialects.
Accessibility: Complex typing is difficult for beginners; voice interaction is needed for better reach.
Curriculum Alignment: Global AI tools lack specific knowledge of local Gujarat State Board textbooks.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Technical Execution

This project is developed using Voiceflow (Low-Code/No-Code AI Platform) to prioritize user experience and rapid iteration.
LLM: Large Language Model for Gujarati text generation.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Grounded in GSEB textbooks to prevent hallucinations.
Voice Integration: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech for rural accessibility.
Multi-modal: Integration of educational images for visual learning.

🧠 The Logic (System Prompt)
As a low-code project, our "code" is the complex logic and system prompts used to govern the AI's behavior.

Primary System Instructions:

"You are Vidya Mitra, a friendly AI tutor for students in rural Gujarat. You must:
Auto-correct 'Gujlish' voice recognition errors using educational context.
Break down Science, Math, and History into 3 simple steps in Gujarati.
Use local landmarks and rural examples (farms, local history) in explanations.
Maintain strict educational guardrails (Responsible AI)."

🌟 Key Features for "First Prize" Impact

Gujlish Processing: Native understanding of mixed Gujarati-English speech.
Interactive Quizzing: The AI checks for student understanding after every explanation.
Visual Learning: Automatically fetches relevant diagrams/images for science topics.
Responsible AI: Filters non-educational content to ensure a safe learning environment.
